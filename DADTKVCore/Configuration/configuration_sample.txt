# A line starting with a '#' character is a comment.
#
# There are no empty lines in a script.
# You can assume the scripts are correct and contain
# no impossible situations.
# 
# Process P commands appear always before client P commands.
#
# A P command for a server has a string identifying the server e.g. "TM1"
# a character indicating whether it's a (T)ransaction or (L)ease manager
# and a URL for g-RPC calls.
P TM1 T http://localhost:10000
P TM2 T http://localhost:10002
P TM3 T http://localhost:10003
P LM1 L http://localhost:10004
P LM2 L http://localhost:10008
P LM3 L http://localhost:10009
#
# A client (indicated by the 'C' process code) does not have a g-RPC URL,
# but has a path to the client script it is running.

P c3 C client_script_1
P c4 C client_script_2
P c5 C client_script_1
