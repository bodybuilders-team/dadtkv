# DAD 2023-24 sample configuration script
#
# A line starting with a '#' character is a comment.
#
# There are no empty lines in a script.
# You can assume the scripts are correct and contain
# no impossible situations.
# 
# Process P commands appear always before client P commands.
#
# A P command for a server has a string indentifying the server e.g. "TM1"
# a character indicating whether it's a (T)ransaction or (L)ease manager
# and a URL for g-RPC calls.
P TM1 T http://localhost:10000
P LM1 L http://localhost:10001
P LM2 L http://localhost:10002
P LM3 L http://localhost:10003
P LM4 L http://localhost:10004
P LM5 L http://localhost:10005
#
# A client (indicated by the 'C' process code) does not have a g-RPC URL,
# but has a path to the client script it is running.

# F commands describe the state of server processes
#
# Missing time slots in the sequence of F commands correspond to time slots 
# where there is no change to the normal/crashed state of the previous 
# slot and no process suspects any other process.
#
# In a F command:
# - The first integer indentifies the time slot it describes
# - It is followed by a sequence of (N)ormal or (C)rashed characters,
#   one for each server process in the system
# - The line ends with a sequence of pairs indentifying suspected processes
# each pair includes the ids of the suspecting process and the suspected process,
# e.g. (A,B) means that process A suspects process B
